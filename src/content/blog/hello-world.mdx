# Welcome to My MDX Blog

This is a test post for my MDX-powered blog. MDX combines the power of Markdown with JSX components.

## Code Blocks

Here's a simple code snippet:

```javascript
// A simple greeting function
function greeting(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greeting("World"));
```

## Images

You can include images in your MDX posts:

## Custom Components

One of the best features of MDX is the ability to use React components within your content:

<Alert title="Important Information">
  This is an alert component that can be reused throughout your MDX content.
</Alert>

<CalloutBox title="Pro Tip">
  You can create custom components to enhance your blog posts with interactive
  elements.
</CalloutBox>

## YouTube Videos

You can easily embed YouTube videos:

<YouTube id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" title="Never Gonna Give You Up" />

## Links

You can [link to external sites](https://nextjs.org) or to [other pages](/blog) within your site.

## Blockquotes

Happy blogging!
